      While I have my skills listed on my resume, I don't believe that showcases all of the ways I have utilized my knowledge in programming. In addition to the projects listed, I have worked on other more individual projects that did not make the final cut. Many of these happened to use more hardware-based languages than Java or such. A good deal of my side projects use Arduino for controlling ATmega328s and ESP32s. However, my internship at Cirrus Logic showed me how Python is able to be integrated for large scale hardware testing.
      <br><br>
      As a Computer Engineer - Electrical Track, my interest in Computer Science is more geared to the implementation and cohesion of hardware with software. I would like to focus on VLSI, but software engineering is a large part in the hardware side as well. Especially in the creation of new tools for verification and testing, a thorough knowledge of programming will be useful.
