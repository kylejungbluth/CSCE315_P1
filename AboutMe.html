        Howdy! My name is Kyle Jungbluth and I am a Junior Computer Engineer - Electrical Track at Texas A&M University. I have always had a passion for computers, so naturally, I found an interest in the hardware that makes up the devices we use as well as the software side. When I am not studying or working on projects I enjoy cooking and producing music. My favorite dish to make is carnitas since the tacos are quite tasty and easy to make. My favorite genre of music is EDM so that is mainly what I produce, specifically house music. I have played piano since the age of 6 and viola for 6 years. My background in playing instruments definitely helps with the creative process and general musical knowledge.

	      I have lived in The Woodlands, Texas my entire life, and graduated from The Woodlands College Park High School in 2018. In high school I played varsity soccer, so I like to continue that to stay active in college. I play both indoor and outdoor intramural soccer with a preference to outdoor. When I am not playing soccer, the gym is where I also go to stay in shape. Between lifting weights and swimming, I try to stay as healthy as I can, especially now with COVID-19 limiting outdoor activity.

	      As my academic career continues, I plan on trying to find a job in the semiconductor industry. As a computer engineer, the semiconductor industry has many opportunities for utilizing hardware and software experience. I have not finalized a specific area of interest, but VLSI and power systems are interesting to me. So far I have done an internship at Cirrus Logic and will be returning there this summer as an Integrated Circuit Validation engineer. I would like to continue my career there as a full-time employee after my graduation in May 2022.
